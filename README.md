# Dart: Inadequate Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous functions. The `bug.dart` file showcases a function that attempts to fetch data but lacks robust error handling.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error management.

**Problem:** The original code only prints error messages, leaving the application vulnerable to unexpected behavior or crashes without informative error reporting.

**Solution:** The solution implements comprehensive error handling using `try-catch` blocks and provides more informative error messages, throwing exceptions to be handled at higher levels.
